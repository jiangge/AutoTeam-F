# Runtime and Docker Hardening

## Scenario: Docker-Bounded Playwright Runtime

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: any change that touches Docker runtime settings, Playwright lifecycle management, runtime resource probes, background browser probes, `CHATGPT_API_TRANSPORT`, or per-account IPv6 proxy isolation.
- Goal: keep browser automation bounded and observable without changing the free-account registration main flow.
- Applies to:
  - `docker-compose.yml`
  - `Dockerfile.fast`
  - `docker-entrypoint.sh`
  - `src/autoteam/runtime_resources.py`
  - `src/autoteam/playwright_lifecycle.py`
  - `src/autoteam/playwright_probe.py`
  - `src/autoteam/ipv6_pool.py`
  - `src/autoteam/ipv6_proxy.py`
  - `src/autoteam/chatgpt_transport.py`
  - `src/autoteam/chatgpt_api.py`
  - `src/autoteam/cpa_sync.py`
  - `src/autoteam/api.py`

### 2. Signatures

- `collect_runtime_resource_snapshot() -> dict[str, Any]`
- `log_runtime_resource_snapshot(logger: Any, *, label: str = "runtime") -> dict[str, Any]`
- `close_playwright_objects(page=None, context=None, browser=None, playwright=None, *, logger=None, label="playwright") -> None`
- `python -m autoteam.playwright_probe team-member-count`
- `ChatGPTTeamAPI.start_with_session(session_token, account_id, workspace_name="", require_browser=False)`
- `ChatGPTTeamAPI.stop() -> None`
- `build_chatgpt_transport(session_token: str, account_id: str = "", oai_device_id: str = "", proxy_url: str | None = None)`
- `get_chatgpt_http_proxy_url(proxy_url: str | None = None) -> str`
- `get_cliproxy_health() -> dict[str, Any]`
- `cmd_rotate(target_seats=3, force_auth_repair=False, background_post_sync=False)`
- `IPv6Pool.start(active_emails: Iterable[str] | None = None) -> None`
- `IPv6Pool.ensure_proxy_for_account(email: str) -> tuple[str, str]`
- `IPv6Pool.release_proxy_for_account(email: str) -> None`
- `IPv6Pool.status() -> dict[str, Any]`

### 3. Contracts

- Docker Compose must keep:
  - `services.autoteam.init: true`
  - `services.autoteam.shm_size` at least `1gb`
  - `services.autoteam.mem_limit` and `memswap_limit`
  - `services.autoteam.pids_limit`
  - healthcheck using `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/version`
  - build args `GIT_SHA` and `BUILD_TIME`
- Runtime env keys:
  - `AUTOTEAM_MEMORY_WARN_RATIO`, default `0.85`
  - `AUTOTEAM_ZOMBIE_WARN_THRESHOLD`, default `20` in code; compose may use a stricter value
  - `CHATGPT_API_TRANSPORT`, default `auto` to match `D:\Desktop\autoteam-1\AutoTeam`
  - `CHATGPT_API_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, default `60`
  - `CHATGPT_API_IMPERSONATE`, default `chrome136`
  - `AUTOTEAM_IPV6_POOL_ENABLED`, default `false`
  - `AUTOTEAM_IPV6_POOL_REQUIRED`, default `false`
  - `IPV6_PREFIX` and `IPV6_IFACE`, required only when the IPv6 pool is enabled
  - `IPV6_PROXY_*` keys for local listen, public auth URL, allowed IPs, port range, TTL, and pool persistence
- `CHATGPT_API_TRANSPORT=curl_cffi` or `auto` is allowed only for backend API reads. It must not be used for free registration, Personal OAuth, captcha/challenge flows, or workspace UI selection; those call sites must force `require_browser=True` or launch their own Playwright context.
- `/api/status` may include `runtime_resources`, but resource collection must never block or fail the status response.
- Background Team member count probes must run in a killable subprocess and return unknown (`-1`) on timeout/failure.
- `ChatGPTTeamAPI.start_with_session()` must call `stop()` if the browser fallback path fails after partial initialization, not only when `_launch_browser()` itself fails.
- `ChatGPTTeamAPI.start_with_session()` must also call `stop()` when HTTP transport startup succeeds but later workspace detection or admin-state persistence fails.
- Direct HTTP API fetches must close and clear the bad `http_transport` before browser fallback when the transport raises, returns HTML/challenge, or fails again after a 401-triggered token refresh retry.
- Registration and OAuth Playwright call sites must use `close_playwright_objects()` rather than raw `browser.close()`, `context.close()`, or `page.close()`. Direct registration paths need a `try/finally` guard so unexpected page/navigation errors still release page, context, and browser.
- `SessionCodexAuthFlow.start()` must stop its `ChatGPTTeamAPI` instance if page creation, cookie injection, navigation, or the first `_advance()` fails after `start_with_session(require_browser=True)`.
- API-driven `rotate`, `auto-fill`, and `auto-rotate` must not block task completion on CPA/CLIProxyAPI remote sync. Use `background_post_sync=True` so `cmd_rotate()` schedules final sync after the Playwright-bound operation releases task state.
- IPv6 proxy isolation is opt-in. Disabled-by-default installs must not create local proxy processes, mutate network state, or require IPv6 kernel configuration.
- When `AUTOTEAM_IPV6_POOL_REQUIRED=true`, allocation/preflight failure is a hard business/runtime error. Do not silently fall back to direct network access.
- Account-scoped browser and HTTP transport paths must propagate the allocated local proxy URL into Playwright launch options and `curl_cffi` transport construction. Persisted auth bundles should store the public/auth proxy URL only when one was allocated.
- Temporary registration proxies must be released when registration, duplicate-email retry, phone/add-phone terminal failure, or post-registration OAuth fails before the account becomes usable.
- API startup may pre-warm the IPv6 pool only for non-main, non-disabled active accounts. Shutdown must stop pool proxies after Playwright executor cleanup.
- `/api/status` may include `ipv6_pool`, but IPv6 status collection must never block or fail the status response. Return a diagnostic `ipv6_pool.error` instead of raising a 500.
- `/api/status` may include `cliproxy` and `rotation_validation`. These fields are additive and must not remove or rename existing status fields.
- `cliproxy` health must stay read-only. It may read CLIProxyAPI management metadata (`/v0/management/auth-files`) and provider availability counts, but must never call sync/upload/delete/refresh endpoints.
- `rotation_validation` must distinguish `ok`, `degraded`, and hard `failed` results. Hard post-task validation failure may convert a superficially completed mutation task into `failed`; degraded results keep operation success visible and expose cooldown/follow-up metadata.
- `sync_to_cpa()` must refresh `proxy_url` in auth JSON for active/personal, non-disabled local accounts before upload. In required mode refresh failure must fail the sync; in non-required mode it may warn and upload the existing file.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/proc` or cgroup files missing | Resource snapshot fields become `None`; no exception escapes |
| `ps` unavailable or times out | Browser process counts become zero; no exception escapes |
| cgroup memory ratio >= threshold | Log a warning and run best-effort `gc.collect()` |
| browser zombie count >= threshold | Log a warning that init/reaper should be enabled |
| Playwright page/context/browser/stop raises during cleanup | Log debug when logger exists; continue cleanup and do not re-raise |
| `_launch_browser()` partially initializes then fails | Call `stop()` and re-raise the original exception |
| `start_with_session(..., require_browser=True)` or browser fallback starts Playwright then fails during navigation/token/workspace setup | Call `stop()` and re-raise the original exception |
| probe subprocess timeout | Kill the process group/tree and treat count as unknown |
| `curl_cffi` missing or transport init fails | Return `None`; continue with Playwright |
| transport returns HTML/challenge/401 token missing | Fall back to Playwright API fetch |
| `ChatGPTTeamAPI.start()` succeeds via HTTP transport only | Cleanup and reuse checks must use `is_started()` / `_chatgpt_session_ready()`, not `browser` alone |
| `http_transport.request()` raises before or after token refresh retry | Close/clear the transport, then fall back to Playwright using the saved `session_token` |
| invite/direct registration or Codex OAuth opens a Playwright page then raises before a normal return | Cleanup must still close page, context, and browser in dependency order |
| `SessionCodexAuthFlow.start()` fails after creating a `ChatGPTTeamAPI` | Call `stop()` and clear `chatgpt` / `page` fields |
| `collect_runtime_resource_snapshot()` unexpectedly raises inside `/api/status` | Return a status response with a diagnostic `runtime_resources.error`; do not raise a 500 |
| CLIProxyAPI health config is missing or unreachable | Return `cliproxy.ok=false`, `safe_read_only=true`, and a reason; do not raise a 500 |
| CLIProxyAPI auth-file payload is malformed | Return provider/management diagnostic fields; do not treat it as an empty healthy provider set |
| post-task remote sync fails after API-driven rotate | Log a warning, keep the local rotation result, and leave task completion unblocked |
| post-task runtime validation is degraded | Keep the task completed, record reasons and cooldown/follow-up metadata |
| post-task runtime validation is a hard failure | Convert the task to `failed` with a business reason |
| IPv6 pool is disabled | Do not start proxies; status should report disabled/no allocations |
| IPv6 allocation fails while required mode is true | Raise a clear error and do not continue direct |
| IPv6 allocation fails while required mode is false | Log a warning and continue only through the existing direct-path fallback |
| IPv6 status collection raises inside `/api/status` | Return a status response with a diagnostic `ipv6_pool.error`; do not raise a 500 |
| CPA proxy refresh fails while required mode is true | Raise and stop the sync rather than uploading stale direct auth |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `docker compose config` shows init, shm, memory, PID, healthcheck, and build args; `docker run --rm autoteam:fast-0515 status` passes self-check.
- Base: local non-Docker startup still uses the same Python modules and defaults to `auto`, while browser-dependent flows force Playwright explicitly.
- Bad: letting `auto` leak into OAuth/UI flows, swallowing Playwright init failures without cleanup, or running periodic Team count checks in the long-lived API process.
- Bad: guarding `stop()` with `if api.browser` after `auto` transport is enabled; HTTP-only sessions would leak.
- Bad: keeping a failed `http_transport` after browser fallback; the next `_api_fetch()` would retry the same known-bad transport instead of using the live browser session.
- Bad: replacing direct registration's final `browser.close()` but leaving unexpected navigation errors outside a `finally` cleanup guard.
- Bad: adding a proxy URL to saved auth bundles without actually launching browser/API requests through the same account proxy.
- Bad: treating required-mode IPv6 failures as warnings; this hides pool exhaustion and defeats isolation.

### 6. Tests Required

- Direct registration and OAuth cleanup source/exception guards:
  - `tests/unit/test_api_playwright_cleanup.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_round11_session_token_injection.py`
- Status endpoint integration: `tests/unit/test_api_status.py`
- CLIProxyAPI read-only health: `tests/unit/test_cliproxy_health.py`
- Rotate deferred post-sync and validation plumbing: `tests/unit/test_manager_rotate.py` and `tests/unit/test_api_status.py`
- IPv6 pool/proxy persistence and strict required-mode behavior: `tests/unit/test_ipv6_pool.py`

  - `tests/unit/test_round12_s4_register_dual_path.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_manager_fill.py`

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
def start_with_session(self, session_token, account_id):
    self.http_transport = build_chatgpt_transport(...)
    # This silently changes all callers to HTTP-first behavior, including flows
    # that require a real browser context.
```

#### Correct

```python
def start_with_session(self, session_token, account_id, workspace_name="", require_browser=False):
    if not require_browser and self._start_transport_session(session_token):
        ...
    self._start_browser_session(session_token)
```

Use `require_browser=True` for any path that depends on a real browser context. Keep the default environment value aligned with `autoteam-1` as `auto`, and keep `curl_cffi` isolated to backend API reads/writes plus browser fallback.

## Scenario: Multi-Master Owner Fill Scheduling

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: any change to multi-Team owner scheduling, `/api/tasks/multi-master/fill`, `/api/status.multi_master`, workspace-pool owner metadata, or owner/direct-registration concurrency budgets.
- Goal: allow several imported Team owners to fill their own managed children inside one observable API task while preserving the single-Team `1 owner + 2 managed children = 3 seats` cap.
- Applies to:
  - `src/autoteam/multi_master.py`
  - `src/autoteam/workspace_pool.py`
  - `src/autoteam/admin_state.py`
  - `src/autoteam/api.py`
  - `src/autoteam/manager.py::cmd_fill`

### 2. Signatures

- `WorkspacePool.upsert(workspace_id, admin_email, account_id, tier=TIER_WARM, *, workspace_name="", session_token="", enabled=True, parallel=False) -> dict`
- `WorkspacePool.record_run_result(workspace_id, *, last_error="", last_run_ts=None) -> dict`
- `temporary_admin_state(**kwargs) -> contextmanager`
- `build_multi_master_status(accounts=None, pool=None) -> dict`
- `resolve_worker_budget(owner_count, *, requested_owner_workers=None, requested_direct_parallel=None, runtime_snapshot=None) -> dict`
- `run_multi_master_fill(target_seats=3, *, owner_workers=None, direct_parallel=None, workspace_ids=None, dry_run=False, post_sync=True, pool=None, worker=None) -> dict`
- `cmd_fill(target=3, leave_workspace=False, *, post_sync=True, print_status=True, direct_parallel=None)`
- `POST /api/tasks/multi-master/fill`

### 3. Contracts

- A multi-master task is one API mutation task. Do not open independent untracked API mutation tasks for each owner.
- `target_seats_per_owner` must stay clamped to `1..3`; `child_cap_per_owner` is `2`.
- Eligible owner rows come from `WorkspacePool` rows with `enabled != false`, `parallel == true`, `admin_email`, and `account_id`. If none are marked parallel, read-only planning/status may fall back to the active workspace for backwards compatibility.
- Per-owner workers must use `temporary_admin_state(...)` so `ChatGPTTeamAPI.start()` reads the owner-local session/account/workspace data without mutating global `state.json`.
- Owner worker failures are isolated. One failed owner becomes one failed result row and must not prevent other submitted owners from completing.
- `session_token` may be persisted in the local workspace pool for imported owners, but API status and task results must expose only `session_present`, never the raw token.
- `MULTI_MASTER_MAX_OWNER_WORKERS`, `MULTI_MASTER_BROWSER_BUDGET`, `MULTI_MASTER_MEMORY_DOWNGRADE_RATIO`, and `DIRECT_REGISTER_PARALLEL` are the scheduling budget inputs. `run_multi_master_fill()` must pass the resolved `direct_register_parallel` into `cmd_fill(..., direct_parallel=...)`, and `cmd_fill()` must pass it into `create_new_account(..., parallel=...)`.
- When owner workers call `cmd_fill`, they must set `post_sync=False`, `print_status=False`, and the budgeted `direct_parallel` value. The parent multi-master task may run CPA sync once after all owners finish; a post-sync failure should be reported in `post_sync` without converting completed owner work into failed owner work.
- `/api/status.multi_master` is additive. It must not remove or rename existing status fields and must not raise a 500 if multi-master diagnostics fail.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| No eligible owners | Return `status="no_owners"` and `owner_workers=0`; do not start owner work |
| `dry_run=true` | Return a completed plan without creating a background task |
| Owner row has no session token | Mark it non-runnable in status; execution may fail only that owner |
| Runtime memory ratio >= `MULTI_MASTER_MEMORY_DOWNGRADE_RATIO` | Force `owner_workers=1` and `direct_register_parallel=1` with reason `memory_high` |
| `owner_workers * direct_register_parallel` exceeds `MULTI_MASTER_BROWSER_BUDGET` | Clip both values to stay within the global browser budget |
| Owner worker starts `cmd_fill` | Pass the resolved `direct_parallel`; do not leave it as display-only metadata |
| One owner worker raises | Record `last_error` for that workspace and return overall `partial_failed` when other owners complete |
| All owner workers raise | Return overall `failed` |
| Parent post-sync raises | Return `post_sync.ok=false`; keep per-owner results intact |
| `/api/status.multi_master` builder raises | Return an error diagnostic block instead of failing `/api/status` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: two imported owners marked `parallel=true` are filled inside one `multi-master-fill` task, each owner uses its own temporary admin state, and final `post_sync` runs once.
- Good: a multi-master dry-run/result reports the same `direct_register_parallel` that execution passes into `cmd_fill`.
- Base: a single-owner install with no parallel rows still reports compatible status and can dry-run against the active workspace.
- Bad: increasing `target` above `3` to gain throughput, because this breaks the Team-seat contract.
- Bad: calling `cmd_fill()` concurrently with its default `post_sync=True`, because each worker would race remote CPA sync and make delete-guard behavior harder to reason about.
- Bad: returning `session_token` in `/api/status.multi_master.owners` or task result rows.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/unit/test_multi_master.py`
  - `temporary_admin_state` overrides owner state without mutating disk.
  - `WorkspacePool.upsert` persists owner metadata and keeps the active-workspace invariant.
  - `build_multi_master_status` groups accounts by `workspace_account_id` and omits session tokens.
  - `resolve_worker_budget` downgrades on high memory and clips by browser budget.
  - `run_multi_master_fill` isolates owner failures, records `last_error`, suppresses worker-local sync/status, passes `direct_parallel` into `cmd_fill`, and reports parent `post_sync`.
  - API dry-run returns a plan and passes request parameters through.
- Existing single-owner regressions must still pass:
  - `tests/unit/test_round12_s7_workspace_pool.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_api_status.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_manager_fill.py`
  - `tests/unit/test_manager_rotate.py`

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
# Starts several independent mutation tasks; each task owns its own view of
# Playwright/resource state and may race the global task lock.
for owner in owners:
    post_fill(TaskParams(target=3))
```

#### Correct

```python
run_multi_master_fill(
    target_seats=3,
    owner_workers=2,
    direct_parallel=1,
)
```

Keep multi-owner work inside one parent task, and make owner-local state explicit with `temporary_admin_state(...)`.
